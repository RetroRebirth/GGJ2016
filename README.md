# Tenative Title: Goat On My Level

Premise: You are run a farm of goats when suddenly several goat demanding demons open holes up in the ground and demand you throw goats of the appropriate color into them. They return your favors with gold, so the town supports this endeavor through goat production and logistics.

# To run web configuration (until I figure it out through intelliJ)

1. go to project root and type: ./gradlew html:superDev
2. wait until it finishes (will take about 2 minutes)
3. open http://localhost:8080/html
